        Scheme names consist of a sequence of characters beginning with a
        letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus
        ("+"), period ("."), or hyphen ("-").  Although schemes are case-
        insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that
        specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters.  An implementation
        should accept uppercase letters as equivalent to lowercase in scheme
        names (e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http") for the sake of
        robustness but should only produce lowercase scheme names for
        consistency.
