Engine is a collection of low level transport protocols implemented in pure Swift intended for use in server side and client side applications. It is used as the core transport layer in [Vapor](https://github.com/qutheory/github).

### HTTP.Server

The HTTPServer is responsible for listening and accepting remote connections, then relaying requests and responses between the received connection and the responder.
